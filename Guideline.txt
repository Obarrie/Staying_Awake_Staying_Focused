ðŸ“… Implementation Plan: AI-Based Drowsiness Detection System
ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Research & Dataset Collection (Week 1-2)
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Gather and prepare a dataset for drowsiness detection.

âœ… Steps:

Review Research on Drowsy Driving:

Study effects of drowsiness on reaction time and driving safety.

Identify facial cues that indicate drowsiness (e.g., closed eyes, yawning).

Dataset Collection:

Use publicly available datasets (like NTHU Drowsy Driver Dataset).

Collect additional real-world samples if needed.

Data Annotation:

Label images as "Alert" or "Drowsy".

Ensure diverse lighting, angles, and facial features.

Organize & Preprocess Data:

Split into training (80%), validation (10%), test (10%).

Apply data augmentation (flip, brightness adjustments) to improve robustness.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: AI Model Development (Week 3-5)
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Train an AI model to classify drowsiness in real-time.

âœ… Steps:

Select Model:

Use YOLOv5 for object detection.

Consider alternatives like OpenCVâ€™s Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) for lightweight detection.

Preprocess Data:

Resize images, normalize pixel values, and augment dataset.

Train YOLOv5 Model:

Train to detect "Drowsy" vs. "Alert" faces.

Fine-tune learning rate, epochs, and batch size.

Evaluate Model:

Use precision, recall, F1-score to assess performance.

Reduce false positives and negatives.

Optimize for Real-Time Use:

Convert model to ONNX/TensorRT for faster inference on Raspberry Pi.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Real-Time Monitoring & Tracking (Week 6-7)
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Implement real-time drowsiness tracking.

âœ… Steps:

Develop Python Script:

Capture live video feed from a camera.

Run YOLOv5 to classify drowsy vs. alert state.

Track how long the driver stays in a drowsy state.

Implement Tracking Logic:

If drowsy for X seconds, trigger an alert.

Store logs for analysis (e.g., how often drowsiness occurs).

Test with Video Inputs:

Validate using pre-recorded dashcam videos.

Ensure smooth real-time processing.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Alert System Integration (Week 8-9)
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Implement real-time alerts for drowsy drivers.

âœ… Steps:

Choose Alert Mechanisms:

ðŸš¨ Blink hazard lights if drowsiness is detected.

ðŸ”Š Play a loud sound to wake up the driver.

Hardware Integration:

Use Raspberry Pi / Arduino to control alerts.

Connect to carâ€™s electrical system for hazard lights & buzzer.

Develop GPIO Control:

Write Python script to trigger GPIO pins based on detection.

Ensure alerts only activate when truly needed.

Test Alerts in a Controlled Environment:

Simulate real-world conditions (day/night, sunglasses, different drivers).

ðŸ”¹ Phase 5: Real-World Testing & Deployment (Week 10-12)
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Validate system performance in a real car.

âœ… Steps:

Install System in a Car:

Mount camera on dashboard.

Run real-time detection on Raspberry Pi.

Test Across Different Scenarios:

Different lighting conditions (day/night).

Various driver appearances (glasses, facial hair).

Highway vs. city driving.

Optimize Alert Sensitivity:

Prevent false alarms due to head tilts or blinks.

Adjust detection thresholds for real-world accuracy.

Final Debugging & Performance Review:

Improve system response time.

Ensure hardware durability and efficiency.

ðŸš€ Final Steps & Deployment
âœ… Deploy fully functional drowsiness detection system in a real car.
âœ… Ensure minimal false alarms while maximizing driver safety.
âœ… Prepare for next phase: Phone usage detection system.

ðŸ“Œ Expected Outcome:
ðŸš— If drowsy for too long, hazard lights will blink and a loud alarm will sound.
ðŸŽ¯ AI-powered, real-time safety system for drivers.
