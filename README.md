📌 Voxel51 Hackathon: AI-Powered Driver Safety System

🚀 Using YOLOv5 & FiftyOne to Detect Drowsiness & Phone Usage in Real-Time

👨‍💻 Developed by: Isaac Gbaba, Osman Barrie, Paul Tran

📅 Hackathon: Voxel51 Hackathon 2024'

📍 Tools Used: FiftyOne, YOLOv5, PyTorch,

📌 Project Overview

🎯 Goal:

Develop an AI-based system that detects drowsiness & phone usage while driving, tracks duration, and triggers real-time alerts via a car’s horn, hazard lights, or radio.

🔥 Why This Matters?

✅ Prevents road accidents due to drowsy driving

✅ Detects unsafe mobile phone usage behind the wheel

✅ Uses AI-powered object detection with real-time monitoring

🎯 What you can do in FiftyOne:

Compare ground truth vs. predicted labels

Filter false positives & false negatives'

Improve dataset and retrain

🚗 Step 6: Integrate Car Alerts (Horn, Hazard Lights, Radio)

🔹 Trigger horn if the driver is on the phone too long 📱📢

🔹 Blink hazard lights or play a loud sound if drowsy 🚨😴

🔹 Wire detection to the car's electrical system (Raspberry Pi/Arduino)

📌 Expected Outcome: If drowsy, hazard lights blink. If using a phone, horn beeps.

🎯 Final Steps

🔹 ✅ Test the tracking script & ensure detections are accurate

🔹 ✅ Integrate with Raspberry Pi for real-time alerts

🔹 ✅ Optimize alert triggers to prevent false alarms

🔹 ✅ Deploy & test the system in a real car setup

🎉 Conclusion

✅ We trained YOLOv5 for detecting drowsiness & phone usage

✅ We tracked how long these events happen using a Python script

✅ We designed an alert system to notify the driver in real-time

✅ Next, we integrate everything into a real car! 🚗💨
